>Monkeyface Pricklebacks are found statewide, but are most common north of Point Conception. They inhabit rock-pool areas between the high and low tide lines, seeking cover in crevices and secluded holes. Some favorite areas include the rocks north of Crescent City, between Bodega Bay and Dillon Beach, between Stinson Beach and Muir Beach, around the Golden Gate, and Shell Beach (near Pismo Beach). They are seldom seen moving in open waters.

Distinguishing Characteristics

>Vary in color from dingy black to brownish-green
Two uniform stripes below eyes
Usually one or more reddish spots on side or belly
Long, eel-like body
Large pectoral fins, no pelvic fins, two spines on anal fin
Adult Monkeyface Pricklebacks, particularly breeding males, have a large fleshy lump on top of the head
Life History & Other Notes
Despite their eel-like appearance, Monkeyface Pricklebacks are not in the eel family. They feed on plants such as sea lettuce, but may also take small shrimps or marine worms. Spawning takes place from early January to early May. The tiny eggs are deposited on rocks, formed into a ball and guarded by a parent. A ball of eggs about 3 inches in diameter may contain between 6,000 and 8,000 eggs.

Monkeyface Pricklebacks are frequently taken by “poke-poking,” a process where a long bamboo pole rigged with a wire leader and small baited hook on the end is inserted into likely crevices or cracks in the rocks, especially at low tide.
## A little history

The Blue Mountains are considered by many to be a hiker's and camper's paradise. The traditional Blue Mountain trek is a 7-mile hike to the peak and consists of a 3,000-foot increase in elevation. Jamaicans prefer to reach the peak at sunrise, thus the 3–4 hour hike is usually undertaken in darkness. Since the sky is usually very clear in the mornings, Cuba can be seen in the distance.

>Some of the plants found on the Blue Mountain cannot be found anywhere else in the world and they are often of a dwarfed sort.

>This is mainly due to the cold climate which inhibits growth. The small coffee farming communities of Claverty Cottage and Hagley Gap are located near the peak.
